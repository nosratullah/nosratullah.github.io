# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome to my personal blog! I'm excited to share this space with you where I'll be writing about my journey as a PhD student in neuroscience, research insights, and thoughts on the fascinating world of neural dynamics.

## What You'll Find Here

In this blog, I plan to cover:

- **Research Updates**: Progress on my work with neural manifolds and low-dimensional dynamics
- **Academic Life**: Insights from life as a PhD student in Geneva
- **Neuroscience Thoughts**: Interesting papers, concepts, and ideas in the field
- **Technical Posts**: Code, methods, and tools I find useful
- **Personal Reflections**: The ups and downs of research life

## About My Research

I'm currently working on understanding how spiking activity of neuronal networks gives rise to low-dimensional spatio-temporal patterns. It's a fascinating area that sits at the intersection of mathematics, physics, and biology.

## Stay Connected

Feel free to reach out to me through the social links on my main page. I'm always happy to discuss neuroscience, research methods, or academic life!

Looking forward to sharing this journey with you.

Best,  
Nosrat
