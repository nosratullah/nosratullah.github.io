# Research Update - September 2025

It's been an exciting few months in the lab, and I wanted to share some of the progress we've been making on understanding neural dynamics through mathematical frameworks.

## Finished Project

### Diffusion-Approximation Framework

Our main focus has been developing a novel diffusion-approximation framework for interpreting dynamics from spiking neuronal networks. The key insight is that we can bridge the gap between:

- **Microscopic level**: Individual spiking neurons
- **Mesoscopic level**: Population-level dynamics
- **Macroscopic level**: Behavioral observables

### Key Findings

1. **Mathematical Bridge**: We've shown how stochastic differential equations can capture the essential dynamics of large neural populations while remaining computationally tractable.

2. **Interpretability**: The framework provides interpretable parameters that enables the use of dynamical system theory tools such as:
   - Stability analysis
   - Attractive properties
   - perturbation analysis

3. **Validation**: Our theoretical predictions match well with both simulated data and experimental recordings from speech processing tasks in human STG.

Always happy to discuss these ideas further - feel free to reach out!
